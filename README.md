# Simultaneous-Optimisation-of-Image-Quality-Improvement-and-Text-Content-Extraction-from-scanned-documents


- Optimization of image quality using SRCNN and modifying it to get improved results for text content extraction.
- Modification of loss function in accordance with 
- Developed a novel metrics for determining the OCR accuracy.

# Experiments

- Develped a 2 layer SRCNN which gives better results in comparison with SRCNN with regularization on the cost of training time.
- Trained an SRCNN model over the results obtained from SRCNN with regularization.
- Trained SRCNN over OTSU of images.
